# Python package with multiple modules, you can include an __init__.py file in each directory to define the package structure.

# You can save the __init__.py file along with the other Python modules in the package directory. Here's an example of what the directory structure might look like:

mypackage/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py

    
# the mypackage directory contains an __init__.py file and two Python modules module1.py and module2.py.

# The __init__.py file can be used to define the package's API and make the functions from the modules available as part of the package. Here's an example of what the __init__.py file might look like:

from .module1 import function1
from .module2 import function2

__all__ = ['function1', 'function2']


# the __init__.py file imports the function1 from module1 and function2 from module2. The __all__ variable is used to specify the public API of the package.

# To use the mypackage package in your Python code, you can import it using its name:

import mypackage

result = mypackage.function1()


# Make sure the __init__.py file and the other Python modules are in the directory where you have your package modules. To save the package to your GitHub repository, follow the steps provided in my previous responses. Make sure the files are in the root directory of your package.
